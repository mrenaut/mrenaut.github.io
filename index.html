                  <p>Originally a fine artist with a love of science and technology, as I progressed through school and became interested in the unending possibilities of digital media, I found that web development was the perfect marriage of the two.  I am fascinated by information, our most valuable resource, which evolved into a passion to become an architect of how humans interact with that resource.  Web development, just one of the latest forms of "art meets science", impacts our world immensely and I'm grateful to be a part of it.</p><br>

                  <p>I strive to never stop learning and growing, and to always make the world around me a better place. Functionality, efficiency, elegance and beauty are my goals in any project I work on.  I look forward to bringing those ideals to your projects as well.</p>
